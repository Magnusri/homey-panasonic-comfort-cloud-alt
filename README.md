# Panasonic Comfort Cloud Alternative

Supports some Panasonic AC devices.

This is a Homey app for controlling (AC and heat pump) devices via the Panasonic Comfort Cloud service.

The app relies heavily on [panasonic-comfort-cloud-client](https://github.com/marc2016/panasonic-comfort-cloud-client).

There's already a [Homey app for this purpose](https://homey.app/en-us/app/com.panasonic.PCC/Panasonic-Comfort-Cloud/), but it's closed source, maintained by a single person (responsiveness is, uhm, erratic), without an official forum (an ad-hoc thread has gathered [here](https://community.homey.app/t/error-panasonic-comfort-cloud-app/65935)).
