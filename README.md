# Panasonic Comfort Cloud Alternative

This is an alternative [Homey](https://homey.app) app for controlling air conditioning and heat pump devices via the [Panasonic Comfort Cloud](https://www.panasonic.com/global/hvac/air-conditioning/connectivity/comfort-cloud.html) service.
It is in early development, so not published to Homey store yet.

There's already a [Homey app for this purpose](https://homey.app/en-us/app/com.panasonic.PCC/Panasonic-Comfort-Cloud/), but it's closed source, with no official forum, maintained by a single developer (responsiveness is, uhm, non-deterministic).  An ad-hoc thread has gathered [here](https://community.homey.app/t/error-panasonic-comfort-cloud-app/65935).
