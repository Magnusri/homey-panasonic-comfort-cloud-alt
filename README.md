  * Vegard Svendsen for [the original Homey app](https://homey.app/en-us/app/com.panasonic.PCC/Panasonic-Comfort-Cloud/).
  * The app relies heavily on [panasonic-comfort-cloud-client](https://github.com/marc2016/panasonic-comfort-cloud-client).  The main reason I got the app working within a couple of hours!
  * Athom provides an easy to use [CLI, SDK and app template](https://apps.developer.homey.app/the-basics/getting-started/homey-cli).  The combined quality ensured I hit the ground running.
  * Thanks to the maintainers of [Homey Community Store](https://store.homey.community) for providing a home!
